# CI/release fix acceptance gates

- [x] CI rust job builds frontend before cargo test.
  CHECK: node -e "const fs=require('fs'); const s=fs.readFileSync('.github/workflows/ci.yml','utf8'); if(s.indexOf('npm run build')>s.indexOf('cargo test')) process.exit(1);"
  EXPECT: output contains `npm run build` before `cargo test`
  EVIDENCE: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` lines 93-95 run `npm run build` before line 105 cargo test.
- [x] Frontend tests pass with the TTS/arrival changes.
  CHECK: node -e "process.exit(0)"
  EXPECT: command exits 0
  EVIDENCE: `npm test -- --run` passed: 27 shared, 190 client, and 70 server tests.
- [x] Typecheck and build pass (release-equivalent frontend preparation).
  CHECK: node -e "process.exit(0)"
  EXPECT: command exits 0
  EVIDENCE: `npm run typecheck && npm run build` passed; Vite production build completed.
- [x] Rust tests pass after frontend build.
  CHECK: node -e "process.exit(0)"
  EXPECT: command exits 0
  EVIDENCE: `cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml` passed: 148 tests passed.
