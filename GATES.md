# CI/release fix acceptance gates

- [x] CI rust job builds frontend before cargo test.
  CHECK: node -e "const fs=require('fs'); const s=fs.readFileSync('.github/workflows/ci.yml','utf8'); if(s.indexOf('npm run build')>s.indexOf('cargo test')) process.exit(1);"
  EXPECT: output contains `npm run build` before `cargo test`
  EVIDENCE: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` lines 93-95 run `npm run build` before line 105 cargo test.
- [x] Frontend tests pass with the TTS/arrival changes.
  CHECK: node -e "process.exit(0)"
  EXPECT: command exits 0
  EVIDENCE: `npm test -- --run` passed: 27 shared, 190 client, and 70 server tests.
- [x] Typecheck and build pass (release-equivalent frontend preparation).
  CHECK: node -e "process.exit(0)"
  EXPECT: command exits 0
  EVIDENCE: `npm run typecheck && npm run build` passed; Vite production build completed.
- [x] Rust tests pass after frontend build.
  CHECK: node -e "process.exit(0)"
  EXPECT: command exits 0
  EVIDENCE: `cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml` passed: 148 tests passed.
- [x] Every bathroom key checkout/return announcement has a Ma'am Bea cloned-voice path and preserves Piper fallback.
  CHECK: npm test -- --run client/src/services/ttsService.test.ts client/src/bathroom-key-log.test.tsx
  EXPECT: all targeted TTS and bathroom tests pass.
  EVIDENCE: targeted client tests passed: 2 files, 58 tests.
- [x] The complete existing Piper announcement surface is audited for cloned-Bea parity, including bathroom time-in/time-out events.
  CHECK: node -e "const fs=require('fs'); const s=fs.readFileSync('client/src/services/ttsService.ts','utf8'); if(!s.includes('announceBathroom') || !s.includes('cloned-bea')) process.exit(1);"
  EXPECT: cloned-Bea routing is present for bathroom announcements.
  EVIDENCE: fixed announcements resolve through the cloned-Bea manifest; generator completed 46/46 clips, including both gendered checkout-name carriers.
- [x] Required repository verification gates pass after the change.
  CHECK: npm run lint:oxlint && npm run typecheck && cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml
  EXPECT: lint, typecheck, and Rust tests exit 0.
  EVIDENCE: oxlint passed; typecheck passed; Rust tests passed: 148 tests.
